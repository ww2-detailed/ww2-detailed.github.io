        <h1>Cause and effects of World War 2</h1>
        <p>The Second World War had many events prior to it that eventually led to WW2, and even more effects that World War 2 caused.</p>
    <div class="causes">
        <h3>Causes</h3>
        <p>There were many causes as to why WW2 started. The most common ones are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The legacy of the Great War and before</li>
            <p>The roots for the causes of the Second World War can be traced back to 1806, when Napoleon created the <strong>Confederation of the Rhine</strong>. It was the first true unified German state. After Napoleon's defeat, liberal-nationalist movements persisted, culminating until the failed <strong>1848 revolutions</strong>, which laid the foundation of the later <strong>German Empire</strong>. An <strong>independent</strong> unified German state meant that it had the capabilities to challenge the balance of power, which would culminate into the <strong>Great War</strong>. By the end of it, however, the political state of the world has irreversibly changed, as the <strong>Entente</strong> had been victorious. This meant that, especially after the November Revolution, that the German Empire be no more, and no one for sure knew whatever the Entente will do with Germany. That is until the <strong>Treaty of Versailles</strong>, which explicitly states that Germany should <strong>take the blame for all of this, the German army be limited to 100 000 men only, not operate submarines, concede territories, demilitarization of lands west of the Rhine, and pay war reparations of 6 billion gold marks</strong>. This was the exact opposite of what the German people had expected; they expected a fair treaty. This would lead to widespread hatred of the Entente powers and the labeling of the people that signed the November armstice as <strong>traitors</strong>. Soon after that, communist uprisings happened in several regions, and because Germany is effectively bankrupt, they couldn't pay the 2nd war reparations, which led to the <strong>Ruhr invasion</strong> by France and Belgium, in order to secure the Ruhr valley for themselves. This led to the 1923 hyperinflation, one of the worst ones in history, and even led to the abandonment of the Reichsmark and the adoption of the Rentenmark. All of this chaos left a hole that would form into the <strong>Nazi Party</strong>, gaining influence from the Germans' anger and eventually taking power.</p>
            <li>The failure of the League of Nations</li>
            <p>The League of Nations was created after the Great War with only one intention: <strong>peace</strong>. However, Congress blocked US attempts on joining the LoN, and without America, the League was basically nothing. And with the new dictatorial regimes in Germany, Italy, and Japan completely ignoring the LoN, it failed to stop wars and eventually World War 2.</p>
            <li>Expansion and militarism</li>
            <p>The Treaty of Versailles has prompted Germany to resent the former Entente and expand, with Germany remilitarizing the Rhineland, annexing Austria and the Sudetenland, the invasion of Czechoslovakia, and the demanding the <strong>Danzig corridor</strong> all throughout 1936-1939. Italy's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutilated_victory">Mutilated victory</a> myth has been utilized by dictator <strong>Mussolini</strong> to justify expansion in Ethiopia, the Balkans, and North Africa. In East Asia, Japan has maintained <strong>militarism</strong>, which is why they were mostly successful from 1931-1943, expanding to Manchuria, Inner Mongolia, China proper, and Southeast Asia.</p>
        </ul>

        <h3>Effects</h3>
        <p>World War 2 had many effects that shaped modern geopolitics. The most notable ones are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The Cold War</li>
            <p>Before <strong>Operation Barbarossa</strong>, the Allied Powers rivaled the Soviet Union, even sending volunteer units to Finland during the Winter War. However, when Germany invaded the USSR, Britain and the Soviets were quick to sign a mutual cooperation treaty and cooperate. This paved the way for the <strong>lend-lease</strong>, and eventually the defeat of Germany. However, due to ideological differences, relations between the 2 superpowers, the <strong>United States of America</strong> and the <strong>Soviet Union</strong>, began to deteriorate. Some even say relations deteriorated even before the war was over, when Stalin, Roosevelt and Churchill had a heated debate on which government should take over Poland post-war; Stalin won. The Cold War officially started in 1947 with the adoption of the <strong>Truman doctrine</strong>, however some historians say that it started a year prior in 1946 with the <strong>South Azerbaijan</strong> crisis, where the Soviet Union refused to withdraw troops from Iran (South Azerbaijan and Mahabad/Iranian Kurdistan) and instead establishing client governments.</p>
            <li>Casualties</li>
            <p>World War II caused an estimated <strong>70 to 85 million</strong> deaths, making it the deadliest conflict in history. These casualties include approximately 21 to 25 million military deaths and 50 to 55 million civilian deaths, with the Soviet Union and China suffering the highest numbers. Civilian deaths were primarily caused by genocide, massacres, bombing, starvation, and disease.</p>
            <li>United Nations</li>
            <p>Following the failure of the League of Nations, the Allies sought to replace it with a newer international peacekeeping organization. The UN was formed on 24 October of 1945, replacing the defunct LoN which was officially dissolved in 1946 however cesed to operate in 1939 following the outbreak of WW2. The UN inherited some bodies of the LoN, and former League of Nation mandates became UN Trust Territories. This time, Congress didn't block the US from joining the UN, instead most voted overwhelmingly to join.</p>
