        <h1>Cause and effects of World War 2</h1>
        <p>The Second World War had many events prior to it that eventually led to WW2, and even more effects that World War 2 caused.</p>

        <h3>Causes</h3>
        <p>There were many causes as to why WW2 started. The most common ones are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The legacy of the Great War and before</li>
            <p>The roots for the causes of the Second World War can be traced back to 1806, when Napoleon created the <strong>Confederation of the Rhine</strong>. It was the first true unified German state. After Napoleon's defeat, liberal-nationalist movements persisted, culminating until the failed <strong>1848 revolutions</strong>, which laid the foundation of the later <strong>German Empire</strong>. An <strong>independent</strong> unified German state meant that it had the capabilities to challenge the balance of power, which would culminate into the <strong>Great War</strong>. By the end of it, however, the political state of the world has irreversibly changed, as the <strong>Entente</strong> had been victorious. This meant that, especially after the November Revolution, that the German Empire be no more, and no one for sure knew whatever the Entente will do with Germany. That is until the <strong>Treaty of Versailles</strong>, which explicitly states that Germany should <strong>take the blame for all of this, the German army be limited to 100 000 men only, not operate submarines, concede territories, and pay war reparations of 6 billion gold marks</strong>. This was the exact opposite of what the German people had expected; they expected a fair treaty. This would lead to widespread hatred of the Entente powers and the labeling of the people that signed the November armstice as <strong>traitors</strong>. Soon after that, communist uprisings happened in several regions, and because Germany is effectively bankrupt, they couldn't pay the 2nd war reparations, which led to the <strong>Ruhr invasion</strong> by France and Belgium, in order to secure the Ruhr valley for themselves. This led to the 1923 hyperinflation, one of the worst ones in history, and even led to the abandonment of the Reichsmark and the adoption of the Rentenmark.</p>
